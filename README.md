<p align="center">Nutriplan is an appointment scheduler and a nutrition plan creator! </p>



This project is a web application built with React that allows users to schedule appointments with a nutritionist. It features a real-time chat, registration functionalities, and management of appointments and patients. Additionally, it queries an external API with over 600,000 products, enabling the nutritionist to have a detailed view of their patients' dietary habits. It also includes a dashboard that summarizes all the macronutrient information retrieved from the API.
